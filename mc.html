      Hey Poor Player
      Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a delightful departure from the norm in a gaming world filled with sprawling open worlds and never-ending quests. It beckons you into a linear, mission-driven experience, respecting your time and offering a well-needed break from open-world fatigue. But don’t let its simplicity fool you; this game packs a punch. The hangar is your creative canvas for your playstyle, allowing you to craft a mech that suits your style and needs, demanding you create whatever build you need to overcome the obstacles you face.

      A fresh and brand-new style of video game for next generation consoles. It feels like this huge open world games can be a chore at times. A lot of these games take hours to get going on, and sometimes you just want a video game you can turn on and start playing. Like many others, this is my first armored core game, and after a few hours, I realize how much I regret not checking out this series sooner, I missed so many armored core titles. It’s kind of hard to get backwards and play some of the older ones now. I hope they see how popular this game is and make more Armored Cores, or add a beefy DLC, I’m willing to pay whatever they charge for more action. I will not lie, I struggled a bit at the beginning, took me a month of on and off playing for the game to finally click. The game officially clicked for me when I beat the boss at the end of the first chapter, I started to blaze through the missions and the arena. The customization is incredible, you can respec your OS chips, and try out different builds, you don’t have to be tied to one type of weapon, although I’m team Laser, it has carried me through the game, 2 upgraded laser blasters up top, and 2 of the 210,000 purple laser guns on the right and left, the build is unstoppable. I highly recommend getting this game. Another thing, I regret buying it for my steam deck, I should have got it for PS5 to play on a 65” OLED with beautiful HDR crystal clear, smooth as butter graphics. See you all when VII drops, God willing!

      Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is another step in the right direction for From Software as a developer. Top class combat and with great final bosses.

      Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon will amaze you from start to finish. Its combat system is challenging and requires learning to handle an Armored Core far from a perfect machine. The dramatic narrative goes hand in hand with the game's missions. Visually, it could be better. However, it must be a solid title that mecha fans should play.

      Armored Core VI is a solid return for one of From Software’s long-dormant franchises. It still carries many of the mech genre’s old contrivances, like its generic mission structure and predictable plot. However, it modernizes mech action meaningfully to introduce it to a new generation. While legacy fans may have some complaints about the “casualization” of Armored Core, I am ultimately glad the series is back and firing on all cylinders.

      Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon has excellent gameplay and with numerous possibilities to assemble your mecha and style of play. However, it is also a title that does not fulfill its potential with the story, with the online and it has a series of decisions that could make the experience more enjoyable. It's certainly a great game, but it could have reached a much higher level of excellence.

      The post-Elden Ring era was going to be difficult, that much was certain. FromSoftware's work on Armored Core 6 is bound to be compared to that of GOTY 2021, and unfortunately it pales into insignificance. At no point do you get a sense of the studio's maturity or expertise. Armored Core 6 could have been anyone's game. A messy title, not very pretty and very repetitive. A game with an archaic, old-fashioned structure that leaves no room for immersion and doesn't even seem to want to draw the player into its world. Fortunately, the gameplay is fun, the sensations are pretty good and some sequences stand out from the crowd. Not to mention the incredible customisation of our mechas, which is sure to delight fans and the big kids in all of us. But does that really justify throwing yourself into the game? I'm not sure. =

      The best mecha game ever made, as well as the tightest built in the AC series. The story, although delivered only via the exceptionally dubbed dialogues, is very intense, nuanced, and immediately warrants a replay in order to get a different ending.
