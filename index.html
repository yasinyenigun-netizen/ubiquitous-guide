    Armored Core VI: Fires of rubicon was released on August 25, 2023 as the next installment of the franchise armored core, The publisher of armored core 6 was Bandai Namco internationally and Developer's were FromSoftware, fromsoftware is the Japanese studio famous for Dark souls, Elden ring, and bloodborne. Armored core VI marked the return of the Armored core franchise after a 10-year gap since the last game in 2013. The game features intense mech combat with deep customization, mission-based gameplay, and multiple story endings. It was directed by Masaru Yamamura, with Hidetaka Miyazaki (creator of Dark Souls/Elden Ring) serving as the initial game director during early development. I personally love the game and think it deserves more than it has right now.
